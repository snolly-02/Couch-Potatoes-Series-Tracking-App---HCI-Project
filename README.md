# Couch-Potatoes-Series-Tracking-App---HCI-Project
Designed a series tracking app through 4 phases: project planning, lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping, and usability testing. Created all prototypes in Figma and conducted remote usability tests via Google Meet and Forms to gather feedback, refining the design for an intuitive and user-focused experience.

# Couch Potatoes – Series Tracking App

**Overview**  
Couch Potatoes is a user-friendly app designed to help users track their progress in TV series. This project was developed through four phases: project planning, low-fidelity prototyping, high-fidelity prototyping, and usability testing.

**Features**  
- Intuitive interface for tracking watched episodes  
- User-centered design refined through iterative prototyping  
- Feedback-driven improvements based on usability tests  

**Project Phases**  
1. Project Planning – Defined scope and goals  
2. Low-Fidelity Prototyping – Created initial wireframes in Figma  
3. High-Fidelity Prototyping – Developed detailed interactive designs  
4. Usability Testing – Conducted remote tests via Google Meet and Google Forms to collect user feedback  

**Technologies Used**  
- Figma for design and prototyping  
- Google Meet and Google Forms for remote usability testing  

**Contents:**  
This repo contains the design files and documentation for the project phases. Feel free to explore the Figma prototypes and review the usability test results.
