# Couch-Potatoes-Series-Tracking-App---HCI-Project
Designed a series tracking app through 4 phases: project planning, lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping, and usability testing. Created all prototypes in Figma and conducted remote usability tests via Google Meet and Forms to gather feedback, refining the design for an intuitive and user-focused experience.
